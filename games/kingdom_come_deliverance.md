# Kingdom Come Deliverance

Kingdom Come Deliverance is an RPG based around medieval and historical events in the 15th century. It's an open world game in what is now the Czech Republic, and the locations in the game can be visited in real life today. You play as Henry, the son of a blacksmith. At the start Henry is a peasant who doesn't know much of anything outside of his day to day life and doesn't have any skills including knowing how to read or fight. The game is a modern take on an old school rpg. Quests play out differently based on different outcomes, or even the order things are done in.

## How I feel about it

This game is one of those games that can't be rushed. You have to take your time with it, and it has a slow start. It can even be frustrating at first as Henry's lack of skills make you feel like you can't do anything. It can also be very punishing. Crime actually has consequences, reputation is a thing. The start of the game feels slow. I think it took about 5 hours before I got cut loose in the open world the first time I played and I got my butt kicked because I should have advanced the main quest a bit further for some training.

At a certain point early in the main story I was hitting a roadblock with two bandits that were kicking my butt. I couldn't believe how hard the game was. I think this is a specific roadblock that many people hit. After many tries and lots of frustration I barely managed to win. But I later had an epiphany that Henry only has a 10 minute course from a grumpy captain at this point. He is still a novice that hardly knows how to hold a sword and these are career bandits. Much later I even found out you can report back and get some men to help you in this fight. So anyways, after this I trained and learned a few more moves like a reposte and combos. Then things kind of clicked. I am not good at something, I should train more in a safe environment. With that I started realizing how much game bias I had and how common sense just worked.

By the end of the game you can take on 5 - 10 people in a fight and win. The combat is both about your stats and your skill. With low stats even the best players are going to struggle. But there is also skill that comes into play. One of the biggest things, again common sense, is don't let yourself get surrounded. Keep walking backwards because enemies will always try to run behind you. This game has fair combat, enough that someone effectively did a one health bar run of the game by preventing all healing. That being said there are times where I kill four highly skilled bandits in some of the best armor, and then a group of seven unarmored peasants down the road with polearms humble me.

Shout out to the best alchemy experience in a game yet. The game has you read a recipe from a book at an alchemy station and it's a lot like cooking. Later perks allow you to automate it, but I found it to be a lot of fun.

I love that you have to learn how to read, I love that there is a drinking skill, I love how rewarding progression of skills and gear feels. Henry literally goes from zero to hero.

I love that I feel like I can roleplay Henry differently across multiple playthroughs. It's so cool how doing things in different order in a quest can affect the outcome, even the tutorial quest.

There are treasure chests and items that feel like chase items in the game. Things that make me feel excited to come across as I explore.

Something I have missed since The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind was the ability to layer armor on clothing. This game takes it to a whole new level and is realistic about how you would want to wear armor. In general you have a clothing layer or padding, a chainmail layer, and plate armor on top of that. It's not perfect but graphically the game tries to make everything look like it is working right. I just love seeing this in a game again. It's such a hard thing to pull off and the game does it visually well enough.

The map is insanely good. There are so many hidden details and interesting things to come across even in the middle of nowhere. So many areas feel unique and hand crafted. I remember walking on the road near Talmberg's castle realizing that they have drainage systems for water across the road and further up the road from there were paths where the water crossed to road damaging it. It's such a beautiful world.
